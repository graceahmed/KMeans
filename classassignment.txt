Now that you know what the kmeans clustering algorithm
 is and how it could be used. Grab some 
data from http://bagrow.com/dsv/datasets.html (Thanks Grace!) .
 Any dataset will do. Be sure to select only 2 variables. Maybe you 
should export to an Excel workbook to better visualize the data. 
Select 50 observations and run the kmeans. Play around with cluster 
size. You'll present your results to the class.

Here's a tutorial: http://pythonprogramming.net/flat-clustering-machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/

Tomorrow we'll visualize all the data.

Note: Try this in Aptana, but if you're having issues switch to Anaconda (ipython)
You should be able to run the same code.
